## Determine Feasability and refine requirements

- POC
  - Technical projects
  - Reduces risk
  - Validate assumptions
- Pilot Project
  - Reduces implementation risks
  - Identify problems not discoverable in a lab
- Mockups
  - Test UI assumptions
- Agile
  - Azure DevOps
    - Repos = Github
    - Artifacts = logs, binary objects, results of build
    - Piplines = CI/CD = automation tool for building
