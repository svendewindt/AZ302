# Design a Business Continuity Strategy (15-20%)

Common faults/failluers to test

- Shut down VM instances.
- Crash processes.
- Expire certificates.
- Change access keys.
- Shut down the DNS service on domain controllers.
- Limit available system resources, such as RAM or number of threads.
- Unmount disks.
- Redeploy a VM.

## Design a Site Recovery Strategy

Business Continuity / Disaster Recovery

- Storm
- Natural disasters

Azure Site Recovery - ASR

- Azure to Azure
- On-Prem to Azure
  - Migration
- On-Prem to On-Prem

### HOW:

- Create recovery services vault
- Initial copy
- Incremental copy
- Start environment

## Design for High Availability

[Design for availablity and recoverability](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/design-for-availability-and-recoverability-in-azure/)

- Redundancy
- Weakest link

| Type of service       | SLA               | minutes per month     |
| ---                   | ---               | ---                   |
| VM, single instance   | 99.9%             | 43.2 min              |
| VM x 2 + avail. set   | 99.95%            | 21.6 min              |
| VM x 2 + avail. zone  | 99.99%            | 4.32 min              |
| App Service           | 99.95%            | 21.6 min              |
| Function              | 99.95%            | 21.6 min              |
| Logic App             | 99.95%            | 21.6 min              |

## Autoscaling

## Data center redundancy

Met **loadbalancer** = Data Center redundancy

Met **Traffic manager** = Region redundancy (a region = 3 data centers), with ASR

Traffic Manager is a load balancer over regions

## Availability sets

- update domain (max 3)
- fault domain (max 5)

## Network redundancy

- Multiple VPN

[Microsoft Availability Checklist](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/checklist/availability)

## Storage types for HA

- Geo-replication
  - LRS or ZRS (data center failure protection)
  - GRS or RA-GRS (zone failure protection)
  - Azure files does not support replication

## Fallback to read-access in the event of failure

Program in the application, to give sensible error.

## Assignment

- Azure site recovery
  - Create a vault
  - Replicate a vm to a new region

## Disaster recovery plan

- Backups: How often they're created, where they're located, and how to restore data from them.
- Data replicas: The number and locations of replicas, the nature and consistency characteristics of the replicated data, and how to switch over to a different replica.
- Deployments: How deployments are executed, how rollbacks occur, and failure scenarios for deployments.
- Infrastructure: On-premises and cloud resources, network infrastructure, and hardware inventory.
- Dependencies: External services that are used by the application, including SLAs and contact information.
- Configuration and notification: Flags or options that can be set to gracefully degrade the application, and services that are used to notify users of application impact.

RPO: Recovery Point Objective. How much data can be lost (1 hour, 8 hours, ...)
RTO: Recovery Time Objective. How much time until backup up and running from crash
