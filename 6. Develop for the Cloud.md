# Develop for the Cloud (25-30%)

## Message based architecture

Messages are used when developing HA and responsive apps

### SendGrid

- E-mail
- Scalable
- Third-Party
- Need a SendGrid account

### Event Grid

Connects a lot of event sources to a lot of event handlers

### Azure Relay Service - Service bus

Relay Service allows messages to be passed from the Internet inside the company firewall to specific endpoints such as WCF.

Application inside network opens up outbound connection to Azure and stays open.

- Hybrid Connections sophisticated
  - Based on BizTalk
  - Uses standard web sockets
- WCF Relay
  - Legacy offering
  - Only supports HTTP, limited platform support

### Notification Hub

Limited use. Send events to Push Notification Service, Firebase Cloud Messaging, ... 

PUSH notifications to mobile devices

### Event Hub - IOT / monitoring

Accepts events and store them. Receivers consume them on their own term.

Big data streaming platform

### Service Bus Queue

Enterprise-grade messaging service, supports guaranteed delivery.

Publisher - Subscriber

### Microsoft Graph API

To integrate with O365, IE to connect to Outlook.

### Assignment: Asynchronous Development

Implement asynchronous code.

- Create a storage account (far away, we need lag)
- VS 2017, with Azure SDK
- Console App
- Connect to Storage Account
  - Get the connection string
  - write a method that creates 1000 little blob files using a loop
  - be verbose on the console
  - ensure the method has the async keyword
  - call the method in the body using the await keyword

## AutoScaling

Scale patterns

- On and off
- Adding resources (more users)
- Unpredictable autoscaling (monitoring cpu, memory, application insights metric, ...)
- Predictable autoscaling (by schedule)
